# ai<sup>2</sup>-kit

A toolkit featured ***a**rtificial **i**ntelligence Ã— **a**b **i**nitio* for computational chemistry research.

*Please be advised that `ai2-kit` is still under heavy development and you should expect things to change often. We encourage people to play and explore with `ai2-kit`, and stay tuned with us for more features to come.*


## Feature Highlights
* A general purpose automated workflow that implements Closed-Loop Learning (CLL) pattern to train Machine Learning Potential (MLP) models.
* Featured tools for Electrochemistry research:
    * Automated FEP workflows to train MLP models and calculate redox potential, pKa, solvation, etc.
* Utilities to execute and manage jobs in local or remote HPC job scheduler.
* Utilities to simplified automated workflows development with reusable components. 

## Installation
```bash
# It requires Python >= 3.8
pip install ai2-kit  
```

## Use Cases

### Train MLP model with CLL workflow

```bash
ai2-kit cll-mlp train-mlp 
```

The CCL-MLP workflow employs the Closed-Loop Learning pattern for automatic training of MLP models. In each iteration, the workflow employs labeled structures generated by first-principle methods to train multiple MLP models. These models are then utilized to explore new structures as training data for the subsequent iteration. The iterations continue until the quality of MLP models satisfies the predetermined criteria. The configuration of each iteration can be dynamically updated to further enhance the efficiency of training.

### Train MLP models for FEP simulation

```bash
ai2-kit ec-fep train-mlp
```

`ec-fep` is a dedicated workflow to train MLP models for FEP simulation. Unlike the general purpose `cll-mlp` workflow, `ec-fep` workflow uses two different configurations to generate two different labeled structures to train MLP models respectively. And then use the two different models to run FEP simulation.
