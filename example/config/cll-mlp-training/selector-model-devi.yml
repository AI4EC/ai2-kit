        # The process of this stage is as follow:
        #
        # 1. Get global descriptors of structures, use methods like SOAP, ACSF, etc.
        # 2. Reduce the dimension of global descriptors, use methods like PCA, t-SNE, etc.
        # 3. Cluster the reduced global descriptors, use methods like DBSCAN, etc.
        # 4. Select the most dissimilar structures from each cluster.
